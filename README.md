This trend pushes manufacturers to innovate and improve the nutritional content of their offerings.

**2. Increased Pet Humanization**

The humanization of pets is a growing phenomenon where pets are increasingly viewed as part of the family. This cultural shift has driven demand for more specialized and premium pet food products, contributing to market growth as consumers prioritize their pets' health and well-being.

With the limited supply of traditional protein sources like meat and the rising production costs, manufacturers are turning to alternative proteins such as insect-based, plant-based, and cultured proteins. These alternatives not only provide sustainable options but also help in addressing the supply challenges in the industry.
